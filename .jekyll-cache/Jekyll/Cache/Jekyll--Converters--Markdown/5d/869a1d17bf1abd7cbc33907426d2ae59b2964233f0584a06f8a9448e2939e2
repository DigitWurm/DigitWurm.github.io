I"D<p>When I bought all of Neoncity Records’ releases as a discounted bundle back in October of last year, there was a lot that I was expecting. What I wasn’t expecting was an album like <a href="https://farragol.bandcamp.com/album/ultra-love">Ultra.Love by FarragoL</a>. Against the backdrop of colorful Future Funk and City-Pop inspired grooves sporting concise track lists, Ultra.Love is a bit of a black sheep. First, it’s 20 tracks long, with most near or past the two-minute mark. Second, the track list alone gives you an idea of the chaotic mixture of sound this album promises, with Japanese, Chinese, and wild diacritics mashed together into track titles.</p>

<p>So you can imagine my reservations when it came time to crack this album open, given how different it stands compared to its sun-soaked city-dwelling brethren on the NCR discography. And I’ll be honest, when I first went through this album, I didn’t like it. It was grating. Bizarre. Lengthy. It felt like sticking my head into a dimension of noise I didn’t belong in. But I didn’t get rid of it. Absorbed in the gargantuan task of complete listen-throughs for every NCR release I had bought, I put it right back on the shelf of my music library and moved on. That moment is this album’s saving grace, because it gave it a rare opportunity: a second chance at life in my rotation of music.</p>

<p>As time wore on, I finally surmounted that quest of mine and inevitably returned to the usual dose of shuffling my entire library together for regular listening. That’s where Ultra.Love really started to stand out to me. Awash in rapid drumkits and plucky keys, utterly bathed in pitched-up edits of cheery metro tunes, the music FarragoL had put together for this album started to stand out in a way that was different this time. A way that was welcome. I’ll never really be able to explain why, but I came back to that album at some point and it all just clicked for me. The contrast became something incredibly refreshing. Heavy drums, washed-out backbeats, and deep brass tones, all layered over down-tuned vocals reassembled itself in front of me as the antidote to the tedium of my music rotation.</p>

<p>When you really set everything up right, get immersed in the mood, and throw yourself into this album (like I am tonight while writing this), the experience can only be described as magical. It’s like walking through an old mall at night with your beat-up MP3 player, the speakers in the shopfronts fading through your thin headphones as you wander around and stop to absorb places around the building. The mish-mash of sampling, ambience, and strange instrument choices combines to create an experience that allows you to get lost in it, while also never letting you settle into a kind of monotony.</p>

<p>Most prominently, it provokes this feeling inside you that every good piece of Vaporwave should. A kind of wistful sadness that only gets more potent as you try to grasp at the sounds and ideas just out of reach. Like a dream, there’s this faint emotional tinge to all of it, swirling around you just like the music does, as if it’s a projection of how you feel. Above all else, it makes you <em>wish</em>. What you’re wishing for depends on who you are and where you’re at when you listen to this album. But for me, it makes me wish I <em>was</em> that kid wandering around the mall at night. That my only plans for that brief moment in time are staring at a fountain in the center of some great big window-filled plaza stuffed with shopfronts all faintly whispering their little commercial jingles beneath the pulsing sounds of my favorite songs.</p>

<p>Let me be clear, Ultra.Love isn’t a masterpiece. Some of my initial complaints with the album still ring true. At its best, it’s just as dreamy and groovy as I’ve described. At its worst, it’s a jarring duct-tape job of sounds and ideas that rub against your skin like auditory sandpaper. I think what everyone should know before stepping into this album is that it’s an <em>experience</em>. And I mean that in the sense that some experiences aren’t for everybody. It’s a flawed work, but if you read between the lines, there’s a real gem waiting for you. So if you’re the kind of person that can handle an album that, at times, trips on its own two feet with sound-alikes and curious design choices, Ultra.Love is worth a listen.</p>

<h3 id="notable-tracks">Notable Tracks:</h3>

<p><strong>Ca†alog</strong>: Super deep brass and drums are what’s made this track a member of the top listens for me on the album. Vocals in the second half make it catchy too.</p>

<p><strong>Iwantyousobad</strong>: Breaks rank a bit in terms of the album’s “usual” sound, vocal work on this one really stands out and helps to sell the dreaminess of the track.</p>

<p><strong>初心者の友達</strong>: My favorite of the “Weird Bunch” on this album. Strange introduction and an even stranger switch-up, but the rest of it is too good to leave behind.</p>

<p><strong>HK Tours</strong>: I’d nominate this one for “Most Vaporwave”. It’s got that very classic sound reminiscent of Floral Shoppe. Good stand-out track!</p>

<p><strong>湿仮荒愛</strong>: My most played. It’s everything I love about this album in one sensational track. Groovy, dreamy, slow, sensual, it’s got it all.</p>

<p><strong>Wavesto͠ne</strong>: This one’s a blend of sound that I can’t really describe, but my lord is it a blast to listen to. One of my runner-ups for best track.</p>
