I"{<p>Back to Summer 3 is an album not too many people know about. In fact, the entire Back to Summer series is something that I had never seen or heard of until about a month ago. For the similarly unaware, Back to Summer is a series brought to us by the label wavforme, a Japanese collective of artists all working together to publish new and innovative sound primarily on compact disc. As such, their presence on the internet is best described as “minimal”, with their website being one of the only points of interaction for some time. But in March, the folks over at wavforme HQ decided to make most of their releases available for purchase via Bandcamp. As such, the amazing well of sound wavforme’s members have been cultivating for the past few years is now available to anybody who wants to support them.</p>

<p>As for how I found wavforme, it’s a weird story. I was on Discord and noticed somebody’s Spotify status as listening to a song by Ujico<code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> that I had never seen or heard of before. Now, I’m a pretty big fan of Ujico’s work, and I pride myself on being familiar with a large chunk of his discography. So when this caught my eye, I just <em>had</em> to know where it came from. A little bit of digging later, and I discovered the treasure trove of music that wavforme had just recently made available to the wider world. Unsurprisingly, the track I had hunted down was a part of Back to Summer 3, which I immediately purchased and listened to in full.</p>

<p>So, with all that pre-tense out of the way, let’s dig into the album itself! As far as a general summary goes, it’s good. <em>Really good</em>. Like any collaborative album, its greatest strength lies in the fact that there’s a massive blend of musical talent all converging on a single soundscape. In this case, Back to Summer 3 (and the entire series of BtS albums) focuses on delivering a modern twist to the heavy-synth and big-drum sound of the 80’s. And oh man, does this album deliver. The introduction alone is a fantastic tone-setter for the rest of it, with Dirty Androids’ Holographic Summer providing a masterclass on that classic 80’s sound. It’s got big drums, funky guitar, smooth synth lines, and a fat double-dose of reverb just to top it all off.</p>

<p>But Holographic Summer is just your introduction to what this album puts on offer. The follow up tracks Scuba Diving and Ganymede Radio both act as wonderful elaborations on the ideas that the first song sets up for you as a listener. Each entry in the album showcases a different style and different strengths, which is what keeps the initial premise of the album so fresh throughout its runtime. You range from very “classic” sounding starter tracks like Holographic Summer to the bass-soaked Electronica-esque B-sides Soft Drink Party and Rikka. But the standout track of the album is certainly Neonglow by Ujico<code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code>. As somebody who loves his work already, there is bias here, but this track just blows everything else out of the water by comparison. The panning keys for the lead-in, the powerful synth lines, the drum work, it’s just beautiful. Neonglow is what lead me to this album in the first place, and it rightfully earns its crown as the project’s finest entry.</p>

<p>But like any work, Back to Summer 3 is not without flaws. The A-sides are fairly strong when it comes to original composition and staying true to the theme of the album, but the final 5 tracks start to drift around a bit, with extra stylistic choices that bleed into the identity of the album. I’ve also never been a fan of heavily looping samples, which, while they’re tolerable on this album, still have a tendency to get on my nerves at points. All in all, it’s nothing unforgivable, just low-grade nitpicks that I think deserved to be identified in the name of fairness. I really don’t have any high-level complaints to levy against this album though. It’s a release that’s 100% worth your time and attention (and hopefully your money!).</p>

<h2 id="notable-tracks">Notable tracks:</h2>

<p>Ujico<code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> - Neonglow: I’ve already heaped praise on this one. If you listen to nothing else from this album, listen to this.</p>

<p>MK – Scuba Diving: Amazingly put-together track, deserves its place as the album’s second entry. Powerful, emotional, exciting, and most of all, very 80’s.</p>

<p>Nhato – Ganymede Radio: Immediate follow-up to Scuba Diving, fantastic fusion of a funky and energetic backbeat with a vocoder as a flashy supplement. Definitely lives up to the 80’s fusion style the album strives for.</p>
