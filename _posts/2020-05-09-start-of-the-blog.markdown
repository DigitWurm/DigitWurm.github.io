## It's finally happening!

After entirely too much windup, the blog is here at last! Lots of stuff is still in the works, so I just wanna formally apologize if there's anything that's broken or out of order here on the site right now. For instance, Twitter suspended my account after I claimed it and then just sat on it. So all my twitter links are useless right now. But that's OK! I'm doing my best to get that sorted out right now.

Otherwise, everything's coming together pretty well. I'm going live with this post and two proper reviews, which should be available at the exact same time as this little informational post. After that, I've got a small pipeline of planned reviews that are all in the works right now, hopefully arriving in the next few days as I find the time to work on them.

In the slightly more distant future, I'm hoping to get a Discord server hooked up at some point and introduce new kinds of review formats. But for now I'm doing my best to keep my work scope and ambitions pretty small. That way things don't get away from me too quickly!

Anyways, that's about all for the starting post. Thank you very much for stopping by the blog and checking things out! I hope you enjoy your time here.
