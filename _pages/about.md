### Hi!
 
My name's Jacob, but on the internet I go by the alias "DigitWurm". This is my blog, where I primarly post about music. At least, that's the plan for now. I might do more stuff with this website/blog in the future, but as it stands my only real use for it is as a central repository for some of my more extended thoughts on the music I listen to.

I haven't been seriously listening to music for very long, but in the short time that I've begun collecting music and really appeciating it in a more involved way, I've amassed a lot of it. Along with every piece of music comes opinions and ideas, which until now I've largely just sort of managed inside my own head. But recently, I find myself getting into more conversations with people about this passion of mine, and I finally realized that I probably have enough to say at this point that I can justify dumping my thoughts onto some corner of the internet.

##### So what's the point? 

Hell if I know. I don't really have much of a justification for dropping chunks of my train of thought onto the internet other than I think it might be fun to have some words I wrote look pretty in a text box. If there ever becomes a point, then I'd guess it's for people to read what I'm thinking, and continue that sort of impassioned, at-length, discussion about music. That'd be pretty cool.

Whatever the case may be, you're here. So take a look around, smell the roses, leave some hate-mail in my inbox snidely correcting my grammar, laugh at how much I paid for an album on Bandcamp that I ultimately disliked, you know; whatever pleases you. As long as you're having a good time here in this little web-shack of mine, I'm happy.

Hope to see you around!
